<b>Classes</b> will be held from 9:30 AM to 10:55 AM on Wednesdays and Fridays<br>

The <b>syllabus</b> that we will follow can be found by clicking the following <a href="https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/academic/int-phd-programme/semester3">link</a>. In addition we may (depending on the time available) cover some additional topics.<br>
<b>Grading Scheme</b>: 40 (Final term)+30 (midterm)+ 30 (assignments and recitation); solutions from bonus problems can be used to improve the net midterm+assignment score.<br>
Here is the conversion chart from marks to letter grades. More about the grading scheme can be found by following this <a href="https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/academic/int-phd-programme/grading-scheme">link</a>.

<p>Please feel free to discuss with your fellow students but the solution must be understood and written on your own. At any point the student can be asked to explain a given solution during the office hours. Please do not search for the solutions on the internet. It helps no one (including you). The assignment needs to submitted by email to my Tifr address before the class (scan/tex either will do).</p>

<p>The book often uses open sets when it means regions. By cautious!</p>

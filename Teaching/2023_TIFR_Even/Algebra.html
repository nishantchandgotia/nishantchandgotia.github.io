<p>Please feel free to discuss with your fellow students but the solution must be understood and written on your own. Please do not search for the solutions on the internet. It helps no one (including you). The assignment needs to submitted by email to my Tifr address before the class (scan/tex either will do) or submitted to me in class.</p>

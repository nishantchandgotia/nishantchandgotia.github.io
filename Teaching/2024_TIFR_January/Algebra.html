<b>Classes</b> will be held 9:00 AM to 10:20 AM on Tuesdays and Wednesday starting from 10th of January. The classes will be held partially over zoom and partially in person.<br>
Mondays (9:00 AM-10:20 PM) will be left to casual discussions and recitations. If you have questions, please ask your queries by Friday so that they can be taken up on Monday. Students are expected to attend this session if it takes place because we might cover material in this session.

<b>Grading Scheme</b>: 40 (Final term)+30 (midterm)+ 30 (assignments and recitation); solutions from bonus problems and recitations can be used to improve the net midterm+assignment score.<br>
Here is the conversion chart from marks to letter grades. More about the grading scheme can be found by following this <a href="https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/academic/int-phd-programme/grading-scheme">link</a>.

<p>Please feel free to discuss with your fellow students but the solution must be understood and written on your own. Please do not search for the solutions on the internet. It helps no one (including you). The assignment needs to submitted by email to my Tifr address before the class (scan/tex either will do) or submitted to me in class. Further students are encouraged to attempt bonus questions. They might be used later.</p>

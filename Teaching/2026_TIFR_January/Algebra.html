<b>Classes</b> will be held 2:00 PM to 3:20 PM on Mondays and 11:00 AM to 12:20 PM on Wednesdays and Fridays starting from 2nd of January. One day a week will be left for a short quiz (might change from week to week) and for clearing any doubts that you may have. Please send me your doubts before hand. I am not good at stand-up.
No classes will be held from March 2 to March 13, 2026 except for the midterm.
<br>
<hr>
<b>Assessment</b>: Assessment will be based on texed up notes, assignments, quizes, the midterm and the final term. There is provision for a re-exam.
<br>
<hr>
<b>Grading Scheme</b>: 40 (Final term) + 25 (midterm) + 15 (assignments) + 15 (quizes) + 5 (texing up notes); solutions from bonus problems can be used to improve the net midterm score. In any form of assessment (exam, assignment, quiz), inability to explain the solution will imply 0 on that form of assessment. For example, if you wrote a solution in your assignment which you can't explain, you will not just lose points for that assignment but for all assignments.<br><hr>
Here is the conversion chart from marks to letter grades. More about the grading scheme can be found by following this <a href="https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/academic/int-phd-programme/grading-scheme">link</a>.

<p>Please feel free to discuss with your fellow students but the solution must be understood and written on your own (note the policy above). Please do not search for the solutions on the internet. It helps no one (including you). The assignment needs to submitted by email to my Tifr address before the class (scan/tex either will do) or submitted to me in class. Further students are encouraged to attempt bonus questions. They might be used later in your assessment.</p>
